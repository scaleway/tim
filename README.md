# TestInfra yaMl

TIM is a plugin for [testinfra](https://github.com/philpep/testinfra) parametrizing tests as described by a yaml file.

# Setup

TIM dependends on python 3.3, testinfra and pytest.
```sh
pip3 install git+git://github.com/scaleway/tim.git
```

# Usage

TIM currently supports two options:
 - `--yamltest` registers a yaml test file
 - `--simpletests` registers a simple tests folder

You can run yaml tests on a machine using the yamltest wrapper:
```sh
yamltest --yamltest example/example.test.yml \
	 --simpletests example/simple \
	 --hosts root@testedhost \
	 example/pytest
```

# Yaml test files

## Structure

Yaml test files must have a dictionnary or a list of dictionnaries as a root. Each key is the name of a test function in the test library, and each value its corresponding parameters.

Here is an example:


```yaml
http: [80, 8080]
ssh: 22
file:
 - path: /etc/configfile
   perm: O644
   owner: root:root
```

This test file would call these test functions:

```
test_http([80, 8080])
test_ssh(22)
test_file([{'path': '/etc/configfile',
            'perm': O644,
            'owner': 'root:root'}])
```

## Yaml test modules

There are several modules you can call using the yaml interface. They are documented inside the `testinfra_tim/` folder.

# Simple tests

Simple tests run on the controller rather than on the tested host, but should still be able to connect to it using the environment variable-provided connection parameters.
These settings currenty only are available when connecting over ssh.

```ini
REMOTE_METHOD=paramiko # can also be ssh
REMOTE_HOST=testedhost
REMOTE_USER=root
```

`REMOTE_METHOD` holds the name of the testinfra module being used to connect to the host.

# Additional testinfra / pytest tests

You can also add one or more paths to directories to load tests from as the lasts arguments to `yamltest`. These arguments are directly passed to pytest.
Please refer to the documentation of [testinfra](https://testinfra.readthedocs.io/) and [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for further information.
